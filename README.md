# Description
This repository stores notes, code snippets, small projects, and others resoures that register my learning of Python programming language. I'm planning to implement something near a Second Brain methodology, but not quite shure yet. Fell free to make comments, study the materials and propose code fixes/refactoring/enhancements.
