# Description
Python 3: Deep Dive course series by Dr. Fred Baptiste.

Courses are available on [Dr. Fred Baptiste's Udemy profile](https://www.udemy.com/user/fredbaptiste/). I acquired both the first and last courses of the 4-part series available on Udemy. For the remaining two I will only read through the jupyter notebooks available in the [course repository](https://github.com/fbaptiste/python-deepdive).

The course videos are very good, with high sound quality, providing additional information beyond what is covered in the notebooks and getting straight to the point. However, the Jupyter notebooks are a bit poorly formatted, but it's nothing to worry about. Another downside is that some courses in the series do not offer many practical applications for the extensive theory covered in the videos and notebooks. Including more code challenges, projects, or practical application examples would be cool.
