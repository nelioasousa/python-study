# Description
Flash Cards app using tkinter.

# Features
List of features for the app.

1. Flash cards creation

> The front of the flash card consists of an image and/or text, while the back must have at least one of the following: a title, an image, a description text, or a summary text. The summary text can be rewritten after a revision, following the simplify step of the Feynman technique.

2. Projects creation

> A project is like a theme/subject to group flash cards. For example, if a user wants to use flash cards to study English, they can create a project exclusively for this purpose. Users can create and switch between different projects at will.

3. Flash cards priority ranking

> Each project will rank its flash cards according to their priority in descending order. Cards with higher priority will be the ones picked next for revision. Each card will have a priority score that is calculated using the metadata stored in the card.

4. Custom priority ranking

> The user can set a custom function to calculate the priority scores.

5. Flash cards list

> A scrollable list displaying all the flash cards in the current project in descending order of priority. This enables the user to navigate between flash cards freely without relying on the "next card" functionality.

6. Flash cards filter

> Find specific cards based on criteria such as creation date or priority.

7. Quiz mode

> Review cards in a randomized order.

8. _Dark mode_

> Switch dark mode on/off.

9. _Progress tracking_

> Display user progress, like number of reviewd cards, performance over time, and others.
